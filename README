============================== Description ===============================

INK is a new way to own your content. It’s a well know fact, the content 
you produce can be shared all around the web and in a very large number of 
ways. One of the most common way is to simply copy the content and paste 
it wherever we want it to be shared. That’s fair, but there’s one problem; 
most of the time you don’t get credited for the content you produced and 
the shared content is given out of context without any way to go back to 
the origin (your site!)
